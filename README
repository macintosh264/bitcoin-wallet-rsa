===USAGE===
Use these scripts to encrypt and decrypt your bitcoin wallet using RSA encryption. Both scripts are written using php and openssl. If you are on windows just grab cygwin. To encrypt your wallet (this example is on a mac) just run the following command:

cd <bitcoin-wallet-rsa location>
php -f ./encrypt.php -- ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat

two new files will appear in that directory. One that is about 887 bytes and the other tat is about 3MB. Keep both these files together and safe.

Then to decrypt
cd <bitcoin-wallet-rsa location>
php -f ./decrypt.php -- ./WALLET_ENCRYPTED ./DECRYPT_KEY

a new file called WALLET_DECRYPTED.dat will appear, that is your decrypted wallet.

It is that simple. ENJOY!
